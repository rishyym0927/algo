## 🛠 Installation

Get started with Algo in just a few steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajay-dhangar/algo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd algo

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install
```

## 🚀 Usage

Algo is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Here's how to use it:

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:
```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:
```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 👥 Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels! Here's how you can contribute:
